**📉 Business Problem:**  
Telecom companies lose millions annually due to customer churn. Retaining existing customers is 5x cheaper than acquiring new ones. This project identifies at-risk customers before they leave.  

**🎯 Target Metrics:**  
- Recall > 75% for high-value customers  
- Precision > 80% to avoid customer annoyance  
- F1-Score > 77% for balanced performance  
- Estimated Business Impact: **$2.3M revenue saved annually**  

**📊 Dataset Source:**  
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset (7,043 customers, 21 features)  
- Features: Demographics, services, account info, charges  
- Target: Binary classification (Churn: Yes/No)  
- Class Distribution: 73.5% retained, 26.5% churned  

**🔧 Technical Highlights:**  
- Advanced feature engineering on customer behavior  
- Class imbalance handled using **SMOTE + cost-sensitive learning**  
- Ensemble methods: **Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression**  
- Bayesian hyperparameter optimization  
- Customer segmentation + threshold tuning for business KPIs  

**🛠 Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit, Plotly

### 2. GenAI Research Paper Insight Extractor  
**📄 Business Problem:** Researchers spend hours reading papers to extract insights. This tool enables **semantic search + Q&A** over uploaded research papers.  

**🎯 Target Metrics:**  
- 90%+ accuracy in Q&A tasks  
- 70%+ reduction in reading time  
- Multi-format support (PDF, Text, Docs)  

**🔧 Technical Highlights:**  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (**RAG**) architecture  
- Vector embeddings with **OpenAI + Sentence Transformers**  
- Semantic chunking + similarity search with **ChromaDB**  
- Interactive **Streamlit interface**  

**🛠 Tech Stack:** Python, LangChain, OpenAI API, Streamlit, ChromaDB  

📸 *Output:* Research Paper Q&A Interface

### 3. Retail Demand Forecasting (Time Series Pipeline)  
**📈 Business Problem:** Retailers face losses due to overstocking or stockouts. Accurate demand forecasting reduces inventory costs and improves sales.  

**🎯 Target Metrics:**  
- MAPE < 10% (short-term forecast 1–4 weeks)  
- RMSE improvement > 15% over baselines  
- 95% prediction intervals for uncertainty  

**🔧 Technical Highlights:**  
- Feature engineering: lags, rolling averages, seasonality decomposition  
- Models: **ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, Transformer**  
- Automated hyperparameter tuning with **Optuna**  
- Deployment with **Streamlit Dashboard**  

**🛠 Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Prophet, Optuna, Streamlit, Plotly  

📸 *Output:* Forecasting Dashboard with 7-day & 28-day predictions
